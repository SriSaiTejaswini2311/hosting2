  <h1>Programming Languages Overview</h1>

  <h2>C++</h2>
  <p>
    C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language often used for systems programming, game development, and applications requiring real-time processing. It supports object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming, making it versatile but also complex. C++ gives developers fine-grained control over memory and system resources, which is ideal for performance-critical applications.
